<!-- First, you have to include the following hidden IFrame, which
loads the "Perl runner". This is (currently) necessary because this
IFrame needs to re-load itself in order to re-run Perl. This IFrame
*must* have the "name='perlrunner'" attribute and must be embedded at
the same level as the Perl editor IFrame(s). The frames communicate
via the "window.postMessage()" mechanism, which is safe for
cross-origin communications and sandboxing. Currently, in order to
conserve memory, a single runner serves multiple "clients", that is,
the "editor" IFrames below.

It is also possible to link to perleditor.html directly: if it
detects that it is not running in an IFrame, it will load the runner
on its own (after a very brief delay).

<p>This is a simple example of running a oneliner:</p>

<!-- The following is a basic example showing a single input file and
Perl oneliner.

All files are currently always encoded as UTF-8, which is why the
"-CSD" switch is used below. This is not strictly necessary when the
input files are pure ASCII, but it is important to remember that Perl
does *not* default to UTF-8. Reading/writing binary data via the
editor and runner is currently *not* supported.

Standard input/output redirection is currently not supported. It is
also currently not supported to supply STDIN directly to the script,
the workaround is to use input files, supply the filenames on the
command line, and use Perl's magic ARGV operator "<>". Support for
redirections may be added in a future version.

The JavaScript shown below is not strictly necessary, it is also
possible to specify a "src='...'" attribute directly in the IFrame
tag, for example using the "Copy Frame URL" link shown in the editor.

Note that implementing an automatic resize of the IFrame to fit its
contents is nontrivial when sandboxing is enabled, which is why a
fixed height is used below. However, see for example
http://davidjbradshaw.github.io/iframe-resizer/ - examples of how
to use this are included in the source files here.
-->

<iframe id="perl1" sandbox="allow-scripts" class="perleditor" style="height:20em;"></iframe>
<script>
document.getElementById('perl1').src =
	"perleditor.html#" + encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify( {
		inputs: [ { fn:"in.txt", text:"Foo\nBar\nQuz" } ],
		cmdline: "perl -CSD -pe 's/[aeiou]/_/g' in.txt",
	} ));
// Example of how to use the Optional "IFrame Resizer":
//iFrameResize({checkOrigin:false}, document.getElementById('perl1'));
</script>

<p>This example includes several files:</p>

<!-- The following example demonstrates (almost) all of the possible
options that can be passed to the editor.

The "cmdline" option and the corresponding input box in the editor
only support very basic quoting constructs:
- Strings in double quotes may contain whitespace, \\, and/or \",
  the latter two will be changed to \ and " respectively;
- strings in single quotes may contain whitespace, \\, and/or \',
  the latter two will be changed to \ and ' respectively;
- other strings (without whitespace) will not be modified.
Note: As a consequence of these rules, inside of single or double
quotes, both \\n and \n resolve to \n (for any character "n" that
is not a backslash or single resp. double quote).

Instead of "cmdline", you may specify "argv" as an array ("cmdline"
overrides "argv"). This array should *not* include "perl" as the
first element; this is added automatically.

So that it can be displayed in the input box, the "argv" array
will be encoded into a single string - this means that if you want
full control over the formatting of the command line as it is
displayed to the user in the editor, use "cmdline" instead. The
"Copy JSON" data will include both "cmdline" and "argv" (so you
can choose to delete whichever one you don't need), while "Copy
URL" will include only "cmdline" (for brevity).

You may specify the text of a script via "script", or, alternatively,
a "script_url" from which the script is to be fetched - however, be
aware that cross-origin restrictions may limit your ability to fetch
URLs from other origins. You can specify the script's filename with
"script_fn".

Input files ("inputs") are specified as an array of objects; the
properties of the object are similar to the script: filenames are
specified with "fn", and the text of the file via "text", or
alternatively, you may specify a "url" from which the content is to
be fetched.

The output files ("outputs") are an array of filenames. After the
script finishes, the "Perl runner" will attempt to read these files
and display them to the user. It is also possible to specify output
files with the same name as an input file, for example if Perl's "-i"
option was used.

The current working directory of Perl defaults to the "home"
directory in Emscripten's virtual file system, currently
"/home/web_user", and all filenames are relative to this directory.
You may also specify absolute filenames such as "/tmp/foo.txt".
However, note that intermediate directories are currently not
automatically created, so if you specify files with nonexistent
directories like "/tmp/foo/bar.txt" or the relative "foo/bar.txt",
this will not work.

Additional options: Setting "mergeStdOutErr" to a true value causes
STDOUT and STDERR output to be output together, similar to the way
they would be on the console. *However,* note that WebPerl
currently doesn't think it's connected to a terminal, which means
that perl defaults to block instead of line buffering STDOUT, so
it may seem like you always see STDERR output before STDOUT. If you
want to truly intermix the two, turn on autoflush ("$|=1;").

If you set the "autorun" option, the editor will attempt to run the
script as soon as the runner is ready. *WARNING:* If you have
multiple editors embedded in the page, *do not* enable "autorun"
for more than one editor, as otherwise you will likely trigger a
race condition, resulting in an error being shown to the user.
